## 💻 How It Works

### Auto-Saving Modes

1. **`localStorage` (Default)**:
   Every keystroke triggers a debounced (500ms) save to your browser's local storage. Your content persists across page reloads and browser sessions.

2. **Local File Link (File System Access API)**:
   Click **`💾 Vincular fitxer local` / `Link Local File`** to select or create a `.md` file on your computer. When linked, every auto-save automatically updates the file on your hard drive (supported in Chromium browsers: Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera).

## 🛠️ Local Development & Deployment

### Running Locally
Since the application is purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve it using any static web server:

```bash
# Using python
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using npx
npx serve .
```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update README and project documentation"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. In your GitHub repository settings, navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, select `Deploy from a branch` and set the branch to `main` and path to `/ (root)`.
